Today we will have a look through the course [self-quiz](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week48/Friday/ET_SelfTest_Week48.pdf) followed by a fun [Jeopardy quiz](https://jeopardylabs.com/play/evolutionary-thinking-second-half)!

The answers for the self-quiz will show up [here](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week48/Friday/ET_SelfTest_Week48_ans.pdf) after the session.

The third hand-in submissions will be discussed [next Wednesday](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/edit/main/week49/Wednesday/) :)
