Today we are going to discuss a paper exploring mutation rate variability and evolution in the vertebrate germline - please read it by Wednesday:

Hallast et al. [Assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes reveals extensive complexity and variation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06425-6). Nature, 2023.
