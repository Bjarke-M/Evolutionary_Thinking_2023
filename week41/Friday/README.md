# Friday - Week 41

## Work plan

### Selection tests - R exercises

Today we will dive more into selection tests using the exercises in our brand-new [R markdown](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/tree/main/week41/Friday/seltest.Rmd).
There is also going to be a fun Jeopardy quiz!

We will also see what [Hand-in II](https://github.com/Bjarke-M/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/tree/main/handin_2) is all about - very quickly at the end of the lecture.

Enjoy the session as well as the vacation coming after it!
