# Friday - Week 41

[slides for today](slides.pdf)

## Work plan

### Selection tests - R exercises

Today we will look back at some of our previous topics and interpret selection using the exercises in our brand-new [R markdown](seltest.Rmd). The data you will need to run the exercises is available [here](../../week41/Friday/dnds_ex/).
There is also going to be a fun Jeopardy quiz!

We will also see what [Hand-in 2](../../handin_2) is all about - very quickly at the end of the lecture.

Enjoy the session as well as the vacation coming after it!
