## Work plan

### Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 7, 8

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises, Chapter 7 and 8. Since it's quite some, try to do some work at home and leave the exercises you find more difficult to do in class. 

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
