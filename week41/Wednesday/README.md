# Tuesday Week41

## Work plan

### Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 7, 8

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises, Chapter 7 and 8. Since it's quite some, try to do some work at home and leave the exercises you find more difficult to do in class. Also check out the R markdowns for [chapter 7](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week41/Wednesday/NS_ch7.Rmd) and [chapter 8](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week41/Wednesday/NS_ch8.Rmd)!

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
