# Wednesday Week43

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the ILS paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### ILS PAPER (IKER et al.)

You should read this paper before Wednesday class:

Iker Rivas-Gonz√°lez et al. [Pervasive incomplete lineage sorting illuminates speciation and selection in primates](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4409).

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXTA4eyAgJLPCbEiUYZVlpczaAH6i6zTGkaXXb5ha4I/edit?usp=sharing).
