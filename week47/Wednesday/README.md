Today we are going to discuss a paper exploring mutation rate variability and evolution in the vertebrate germline - please read it by Wednesday:

Bergeron et al. [Evolution of the germline mutation rate across vertebrates](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05752-y). Nature, 2023.

You can find the questions for the paper discussion [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGIIw8GC4Yiqde5dtM2opkC3IFs3zGSvQen0N-5Rpuk/edit?usp=sharing).

Some guideline answers to the questions will show up [here](Bergeron_paper_answers.md) after the TA session :)
