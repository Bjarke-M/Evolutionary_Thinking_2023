# Wednesday Week46

## Work plan

[slides](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week46/Wednesday/Week46_Wed.pdf) for today

We are going to discuss a paper describing the assembly of the first Neandertal draft genome and some basic phylogenetic analyses featuring it:

Green et al. [A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1188021). Science, 2010.

Please go through the paper, then find the questions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2yJCtJr9NPWdR27IUuadV01g59S9eYN_eJN6oOfW6A).

Some guideline answers to the questions will show up [here](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week46/Wednesday/Green_paper_answers.txt) after the TA session :)
