    "In `WrightFisherTutorial.ipynb`, we simulated the frequency of an allele forward in time. In this tutorial, we will instead simulate the genealogy of several individuals backward in time. This process is known as the coalescent and is widely used in population genetics. One of main advantages of coalescent simulations is that they are computationally efficient as we only keep track of a few individuals when going back in time. However, one drawback is that is it very difficult to incorporate selection. We will be using `msprime`, a popular and widely used coalescent simulator, to simulate genealogies.\n"
