# Friday Week39

[slides for today](Week_5_s2.pdf)

## Work plan

### 1. Wright-Fisher model simulations and Coalescence simulations

We are going to revise some of the concepts you have learned during the lectures from a more practical perspective: the Wright-Fisher model and the basics of coalescence theory. Please start with the [Wright Fisher exercises](WrightFisherTutorial.ipynb) and then proceed to [coalescent exercises](CoalescentTutorial.ipynb).

### 2. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapters 1-3

If there is time left, we will finish the book exercises.
