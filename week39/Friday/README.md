# Friday Week39

[slides for today](https://github.com/Jilong-Jerome/Evolutionary_Thinking_2022/blob/main/week39/Friday/Week_5_s2.pdf)

## Work plan

### 1. Wright-Fisher model simulations and Coalescence simulations

We are going to revise some of the concepts you learned during lectures from a more practical perspective: the Wright Fished model and the basics of Coalescence theory. You should start with the [Wright Fisher exercise](https://github.com/Bjarke-M/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week39/Friday/WrightFisherTutorial.Rmd) and then, jump to the [coalescence exercise](CoalTutorial.md). These exercises are run in R.

### 2. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 1, 2, 3

If there is time left, we will finish the book exercises.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
