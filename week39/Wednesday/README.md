## Work plan

### 1. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapters 1-3

During this TA session you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises in Chapters 1 to 3. Since it
is quite a few of them, try to do some work at home and leave the exercises you find more difficult to do in class.

Because the exercises can't be publicly distributed, you will find two links in this week's directory under the "
Materials" section in Black Board, one for the exercises and the other for the Google Docs.

Solutions to odd numbered exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be
found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf). The can also be found in the Quarto
notebook [exercises.qmd](exercises.qmd).
