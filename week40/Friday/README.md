## Work plan

### Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 4, 5, 6 - with a twist

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises from Chapter 4, 5 and 6 that you did not cover last session.
The exercises can be found in these three R markdown files: [Chapter 4](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week40/Friday/NS_ch4.Rmd), [Chapter 5](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week40/Friday/NS_ch5.Rmd), and [Chapter 6](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week40/Friday/NS_ch6.Rmd).

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
