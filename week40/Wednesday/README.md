## Work plan

### Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 4, 5, 6

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises, Chapter 4, 5 and 6. We will try to cover the ones you find more problematic today, and solve some of them in R on Friday.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
