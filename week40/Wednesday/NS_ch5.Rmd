## Chapter 5: Inferring Population History and Demography

In the following exercises you will be exposed to some of the analysis of Chapters 4, 5, and 6 from the textbook
(An introduction to Population Genetics - Nielsen and Slatkin). You will be asked to apply the R functions
in 2 real datasets and in examples from the book. This document can be updated with comments and be
compiled to a pdf version using the Knit command. Feel free to do it so! Good luck! :)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Exercise 5.1

# we again define the Fst function:

wahlund_effect <- function(matrix){
  h_s_ = vector()
  fs = vector()

  for(i in 1:dim(matrix)[1]){
    fs[i] = sum(matrix[i,1] + matrix[i,2]/2)/sum(matrix[i,])
  }
  N = length(fs)
  
  for(i in seq_along(fs)){
    h_s_[i] = 2*fs[i]*(1- fs[i])
  }
  
  f_A = sum(fs)/N
  h_s <- sum(h_s_)/N

  if(N == 2){
    h_t = sum(fs)*(1-(sum(fs)/N))
  }
  else{
  h_t = 2*f_A*(1-f_A)
  }
  FST = (h_t - h_s)/h_t
  combined = c(FST, h_s, h_t)
  print('Fst h_S h_T')
  return(combined)
}

# then, just as in exercise 4.7, we apply (4.21) to obtain:
#Time = 2*FST[1]/(1- FST[1])

# we calculate Fst and then coalescent time:
pop1 = c(12, 22, 6)
names(pop1) = c('AA', 'Aa', 'aa')
pop2 = c(32, 6, 2)
names(pop2) = c('AA', 'Aa', 'aa')
pop_new2 = rbind(pop1, pop2)

FST = wahlund_effect(pop_new2)

Time = 2*FST[1]/(1- FST[1])
two_N = 10000
r_year = 5

# and convert to years time:
print("")
print("Divergence years:")
Time*two_N*r_year
```

#Exercise 5.2

# see textbook for figure
# position 1: A->C
# position 2: C->G
# position 3: A->T/T->A
# position 4: G->C
# position 5: C->T
# position 6: n/a
# position 7: A->G/G->A

```

```{r}
#Exercise 5.3

#a. Tree A - the two lineages diverge deep in time to give rise to the two populations

#b. B - multiregional (extensive admixture, no clear phylogenetic division between pop1 and pop2)
#   E - OoA (monophyletic population diverging from ancestral lineage, but showing some degree of deep relatedness to specific lineages within the latter)

#c. A, D, E (no admixture) and F (ancient admixture)

```

```{r}
# Exercise 5.4

# Theta likelihood function:

theta = seq(from = 0, to = 20)
Pr = ((1/(1 + theta))*(theta/(1 + theta))^4)
names(Pr) = theta

# These are all the probabilities for the given thetas. We plot it:
plot(theta, Pr, type = 'l', ylab = 'Likelihood of theta')

# Watterson's estimator:
n = 2
d = 4
theta_w = 2*d/n*(n- 1) # number of differences divided by the number of combinations
abline(v = theta_w, col = 'red', lty = 2)
max_likelihood = max(Pr)
abline(h = max_likelihood, col = 'black', lty = 2)

```

```{r}
# Exercise 5.5
# The posterior probability of observing genotype aa is:
# probability of observing genotype aa given it comes from pop1*probability of being in this region / probability of observing genotype aa given it #comes from pop1*probability of being in this region + probability of observing genotype aa given it comes from pop2*probability of being in this region

# 5.5 a
pop_new2

p1 = p2 = 0.5
faa_1 = pop_new2[1,3]
faa_2 = pop_new2[2,3]
(pos1 = faa_1*p1/(faa_1*p1 + faa_2*p2))

# 5.5 b
p1 = 0.1
p2 = 0.9
(pos2 = faa_1*p1/(faa_1*p1 + faa_2*p2))
