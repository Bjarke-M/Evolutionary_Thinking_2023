# Wednesday Week44

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the X chromosome and the association with archaic admixture and answer some questions about it in a shared GoogleDocs document.

### Extraordinary selection on the human X chromosome associated with archaic admixture

Paper: [Extraordinary selection on the human X chromosome associated with archaic admixture Skov et al. (2023)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666979X23000344)

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DTDYiccDXrsjZUA04LWVTidfsK7i7nTZmAKW1O2SRw/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions, and you will subsequently discuss the answers with other groups.
