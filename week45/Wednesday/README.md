# Wednesday Week45

## Work plan

We are going to discuss a paper about telling human missense variants apart by deleteriousness and how primate variants are important to achieving this:

Hong Gao and colleagues. [The landscape of tolerated genetic variation in humans and primates](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn8197). Science, 2023
